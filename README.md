🍓 Hi, welcome to my little web space!
I'm Lovely, someone who enjoys making simple and cute websites, playing cozy games, trying out random recipes 🍳, and watching movies (even if I forget the plot halfway).

🍬 I live somewhere sweet (yes, snacks are always welcome).
Some of my faves: KinderJoy, soy milk, mac & cheese, instant noodles, and of course... DONUTS 🍩 — top-tier comfort food.

🙅🏻‍♀️ Not a fan of: raw onions, pineapple jam, or anything burnt. NOPE.

💻 Currently working on:
— lovely.html → a soft strawberry-themed homepage 🍓
— lucu1.css → adds that extra cute touch 💅
— ...and a few other fun files I like to mess around with 🎨

📮 Feel free to check things out, or drop by my [Instagram]https://www.instagram.com/queenssly_?igsh=dHc1dzNjbDMzOWM=) if u wanna say hi 🍓

🧃 This space is built with trial, error, chill vibes, and way too many snack breaks 🍥✨
